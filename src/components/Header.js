                    100 Million. That’s how many times DirectKey has unlocked doors in the past 5 years alone, across 2000 cities globally. Every one of those doors is a cause for confidence for taking your property into the contactless era.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DirectKey allows guests to use Bluetooth® technology to unlock the door while approaching it, without touching a phone to the reader - just secure and smooth entry into spaces across the property from the parking garage, to elevators, to guest rooms and beyond.
